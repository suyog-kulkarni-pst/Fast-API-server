# Fast-API-server
Dummy API server to test your API locally

### TODO
- [ ] setup process
- [ ] Add multi-obj support (currently only supports dicts)
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] PRobably host it somewhere (thinking about Firebase can do uptime robot with Replit or Cloudflare let's see)

Can create dummy API servers using this just update the **db.json** file with the API you want to test and use it 

Can be simple as a `/` or with multiple paths like `company/address/city/../../.../..n`
